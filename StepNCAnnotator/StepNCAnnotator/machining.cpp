description["face.description"]="A face is a topological entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive notion of a piece of surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented, connected, finite 2­manifold in R m . A face domain shall not have handles, but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop. The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0 ! Xi ! 1. A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face bounds. A face shall have at least one bound, and the bounds shall be distinct and shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished, using the face outer bound subtype, as the outer loop of the face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer loop. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop shall contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen. A geometric surface may be associated with the face. This may be done explicitly through the face surface subtype, or implicitly if the faces are defined by poly loops. In the latter case, the surface is the plane containing the points of the poly loops. In either case, a topological normal n is associated with the face, such that the cross product n \Theta t points toward the interior of the face, where t is the tangent to a bounding loop. That is, each loop runs counter­clockwise around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point up. Each loop is associated through a face bound entity with a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop direction is oriented correctly with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be reversed (FALSE). For a face of the subtype face surface, the topological normal n is defined from the normal of the underlying surface, together with the BOOLEAN attribute same sense, and this in turn, determines on which side of the loop the face interior lies, using the cross­product rule described above. When a vertex loop is used as a face bound the sense of the topological normal is derived from any other bounding loops, or, in the case of a face surface, from the face geometry and the same sense flag. If the face has only one bound and this is of type vertex loop, then the interior of the face is the domain of the face surface.face geometry. In such a case the underlying surface shall be closed (e.g. a spherical surface.) The situation is different for a face on an implicit planar surface, such as one defined by poly ­ loops, which has no unique surface normal. Since the face and its bounding loops lie in a plane, the outer loop can always be found without ambiguity. Since the face is required to be finite, the face interior must lie inside the outer loop, and outside each of the remaining loops. These conditions, together with the specified loop orientations, define the topological normal n using the cross­product rule described above. All poly loop orientations for a given face shall produce the same value for n.";

As both a face and a geometric surface have defined normal directions, a BOOLEAN flag (the orientation attribute) is used to indicate whether the surface normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the face normal direction.

In this part the following features are foreseen as they are used in different technology specific parts of ISO 14649: planar face, pocket, slot, step, hole, generic feature, and compound feature. The features are defined in close resemblance to ISO 10303-224. 2½D machining is characterised by the fact that most tool movements occur only in the xy plane while the z axis is preset to a certain depth in order to remove a layer of material. For this reason, all machining features have a depth. All feature geometry, e.g. the contour describing the outline of a pocket, is described in a local xyz co-ordinate system. The definition of the coordinate systems orientation is given in the machining method specific parts. The surrounding surface of the workpiece and the definition of the planar contour of the feature are assumed to lie in the xy plane (z = 0). The material is assumed to be in negative z direction of the xy-plane. In other words, a positive depth within a machining operation requires the tool to advance in negative z direction into the materials direction. As ISO 14649 allows for a 3D description of the overall workpiece geometry, the inherited attribute feature_placement specifies the actual location of the feature within the workpiece co-ordinate system.";

The reason for this design is the possibility to re-use the information specified for an operation for several features of the workpiece. An operation can be associated with multiple features and can be used in different locations. A workingstep, on the other hand, is unique. Duplicating a workingstep in a workplan will replicate the exact same physical machine action. For more information on operations";

description["machining_workingstep.description"]="Machining workingsteps represent the machining process for a specified area of the workpiece. As opposed to the other workingsteps, machining workingsteps cannot exist independent of a feature. Rather, they specify the association between a distinct feature and an operation to be performed on the feature. This removes the ambiguity of the n:1 relation between features and operations, thus creating an unambiguous specification which can be executed by the machine. As the underlying operation, the machining workingstep is characterised by the use of a single tool and a set of technological parameters which normally remain constant during the reign of this machining workingstep. Upon the execution of a machining workingstep the first operation will be, if necessary, a tool change. During the machining workingstep, no tool change is possible. The machine is instructed to reach the operating conditions specified by its_operation (attributes its_tool and its_technology) before the operation of the workingstep commences. If the machine is unable to reach these conditions during the preceding workingstep (e.g. during a preceding rapid movement) a halt will occur before the execution of the workingstep until all parameters are stable.

description["rapid_movement.description"]="For rapid movements between two workingsteps the entity rapid_movement is used. If no toolpath is given, i. e. the inherited attribute its_toolpath is not set, the NC controller will move the tool in rapid motion from the current position to the beginning of the next workingstep which needs to have a defined starting point. The connection will be done via the security plane. If a toolpath is specified, this toolpath will be executed in rapid motion. Note that a toolpath of type parameterised path can be used so as to avoid an explicit toolpath definition in cartesian space. This will provide greater flexibility in case of changing start and/or end points of the neighbouring workingsteps. Unlike a machining workingstep, the rapid movement by itself has no well-defined start and end point unless an explicit toolpath is specified in cartesian space. If rapid_movement is used during a five-axis machining operation, it will interpolate the tool direction between the previous and the next workingstep. In this case, the tool will retract in the tool direction from the last point of the previous workingstep. On the security plane the tool will rotate to the new tool direction, and then it will move down in the tool direction for the first point of the next workingstep. No change of the tool direction takes place during the lift and approach to and from the security plane. However, if a toolpath is specified and the toolpath contains an explicit definition of the toolaxis then this definition will prevail.";

Not that several nc_variable entities using the same name will actually refer to the same storage location. Accessing nc_variables in a program_structure entity may take place only after the previous program_structure has been completely executed by the machine. Note that due to the pipeline concept of most NC controllers there can be a significant time gap between the interpretation of the program and the actual execution. It is there the responsibility of the NC controller to halt interpretation until the value of the nc_variable(s) used are available. This is especially true for the lvalue in an assignment operation because the premature execution of the assignment would allow an ongoing NC process to overwrite the assigned nc_variable before it is used, leading to unexpected and possibly fatal results. Note also that there is no guarantee at which time a certain value from any parallel branch would be available. If timing matters, a synchronising NC function has to be inserted before the use of a nc_variable. Variables can be used to access controller-internal information, like sensor readings.

description["operation.description"]="Operations are used to specify the content of a workingstep. Unlike a workingstep, an operation cannot be executed by itself  unless it is also a workingstep by means of multiple inheritance, like rapid_movement or touch_probing. The latter do not require the presence of a feature for unambiguous interpretation. However, the most typical operation, machining operation, needs an association with a manufacturing feature in order to be interpreted. It relies on the geometric information provided by the feature, namely its placement in the workpiece co-ordinate system. Such association can either be established through a reference from a manufacturing_feature or through a reference from a machining_workingstep which references in turn a manufacturing_feature. The important difference between a workingstep and an operation is in the number of associated features. The workingstep is associated with zero or one features. So at the time of execution the NC controller will know unambiguously which feature to use for geometric placement (or to use workpiece co-ordinates if no feature is associated). A workingstep is thus unique. Duplicating a workingstep in a workplan will replicate the exact same physical machine action. The operation on the other hand can be associated with zero or multiple features. The same operation can thus be used in different locations. The NC controller would be unable to decide on which of the associated features to execute the operation, so an execution of a naked operation is not possible. The reason for this design is the possible re-use of operation data for several manufacturing features. Consider ten identical holes in different positions around the workpiece. They can all share the operation data, but they can not share the workingsteps which represent an operation at a certain instance in time and space. As the heavyweight operation entities can be shared, this may reduce the volume of data to be exchanged. The supertype operation specifies the generic data required by all operations. All operations have the option of specifying an explicit toolpath. For 2½D machining operations, many numerical controls will specify cycles for generating their own toolpaths. However, for older controls which are not able to generate toolpaths or if technological reasons require the communication of exactly prescribed toolpaths, the attribute its_toolpath may be used. Also, the 3-to 5-axis milling of freeform surfaces will typically require the explicit specification of toolpaths by a CAM system.";

description["operation.its_toolpath.description"]="Its_toolpath defines a list of all toolpaths in this operation. Note: If its_toolpath exists, the attribute its_machining_strategy in the subtype machining_operation is for information only. Also, all semantics or parameters provided by the operation will be overridden by its_toolpath. The toolpaths are given in coordinates as measured from the workpiece co-ordinate system or, if this operation is associated with a manufacturing_feature, in the local co-ordinate system of the feature.";

description["operation.its_tool_direction.description"]="Specification of the type of tool orientation used. If none is given, a technology specific default is assumed. Therefore refer to the technology specific parts of ISO 14649. Note that the operation is geometrically linked with the associated manufacturing_feature, if such an association exists. If the feature has a feature_placement attribute, this transformation will also apply to all geometry specified here, i. e. its_toolpath and to all other geometric information like directions or orientations which may be used in subtypes of operation. In other words, all geometry and parameters of the machining_operation are defined in the local co-ordinate system of the feature. As the operation may be associated with multiple manufacturing_features it can only be interpreted in the context of such feature. For features without a feature_placement attribute or for operations without an associated feature, all data is to be interpreted in workpiece co-ordinates as specified by the attribute its_origin of the workplan which uses this operation.";

The tool orientation is always parallel to the third axis (generally, the z axis) in the machine co-ordinate system. Therefore the tool direction will not be affected by any workpiece placements or workingstep transformation.";

description["machining_operation.description"]="Machining operations define the machining process for a limited area of the workpiece, i. e. the contents of a machining workingstep. For the feature to which they refer they specify, at a minimum, the tool to be used, and a set of technological parameters. This data forms an integral part of the operation and cannot be normally changed during its scope. However, for special operations, and if an explicit toolpath is provided in the inherited attribute its_toolpath, it is also possible to specify certain deviating parameters along portions of the toolpath. In this case, the data given in machining_operation serves as default data in case no specific technological information for a toolpath is provided. Note that any parameters or semantics specified by this operation or the associated feature will be overridden by the toolpath definition, even if the actions defined by the toolpath contradict the intuitive notion of this operation of the associated feature. In other words, you can even use a pocket operation to bore a hole. The first tool movement within a machining_operation will typically be an approach movement to the defined start point, allowing the machine to reach its operating speed. This can be either be defined explicitly in a toolpath, or by means of a parameterised path, or it can be defined within the strategy for the operation where the exact definition of the path is left to the NC controller. The last tool movement will typically be a retract or lift movement. The tool movement within the machining_operation, unless defined by an explicit toolpath, will be determined by the technology-dependent strategy and additional parameters as defined by subtypes of machining_operation. Machining_operation is the supertype for all technologies included in ISO 14649. For each of these technologies, specific machining strategies are defined in separate, technology depending parts. They may be used to instruct the NC controller on how to generate toolpaths if no toolpath is explicitly specified for this operation.";

description["machining_operation.retract_plane.description"]="The height of a retract plane associated with this operation. This is not the security plane. The start and the end point of the operation  as discussed in Section 4.6.2.1  shall be within z-direction at the length given by the attribute retract_plane. It is guaranteed that the approach movement from the retract plane to the first cut and the lift movement from the last cut to the retract plane are executed in cutting feed as specified for the operation. A change to rapid feed, e.g. to reach the security plane, can only occur above this plane, and only in the context of a new operation which should be of type rapid_movement. If not given, and if the inherited attribute its_toolpath is not given, the NC controller will determine an appropriate retract plane which may be the security plane. If its_toolpath is given, or if approach or retract strategies are given which do not make use of a retract plane, this attribute will be ignored. Depending on the type of operation, the attribute will be interpreted as follows:  For plane milling or drilling operations, retract_plane is the z coordinate of the retract plane from which the tool starts (for approach) and to which it is retracted (for retract movements).  For side milling, retract_plane indicates a distance perpendicular to the manufacutred surface.  For freeform milling, retract_plane is the distance between the workpiece surface and the retract plane which is oriented perpendicular to the surface normal in the first cutting point (for approach) or the last cutting point (for lift).";

description["machining_operation.start_point.description"]="Optional starting point of the cutting process specified as tool centre point in the local xy plane. The z co-ordinate of start_point is determined depending on the type of operation:  For milling, the z co-ordinate is the depth of the first cut, excluding any plunge or approach movements. If an approach or plunge movement is used, the actual start point of the operation will be the start point of that approach or plunge movement which can be calculated based on this attribute. The start_point will be reached at the end of such approach or plunge. Thus the x and y co-ordinates of start_point not necessarily coincide with those of the start point of the operation, depending on the type of approach or plunge.  For drilling, the start_point is identical with the start point of the operation as no approach or plunge is foreseen here. Therefore, the z co-ordinate is given by the attribute retract_plane. If this attribute is given, the operation has a defined start point as discussed in Section 4.6.2.1, otherwise not. In the latter case, the NC controller will determine a reasonable default. If its_toolpath is given, or if start_point specifies a point violating the features boundary or otherwise incompatible with the machining strategy, this attribute will be ignored.";

For the definition of machining_tool, please refer to technology-specific parts of ISO 14649. It is important to understand that the tool data given describes the ideal required tool. If this attribute calls for a tool with diameter 10.0 mm, the NC controller may select a tool with diameter 9.983 mm provided that it has the ability for on-line tool correction and has the actual value of the tool stored in its tool memory data, and provided that the result of the operation remains within the given tolerances of the feature. (In other words, the NC controller is not allowed to select a 9.983 mm drill if the hole has the toleranced dimension 10.0-0.01 mm.) The possibility to find a suitable tool in the machines tool magazine is reduced the more details for the tool are specified. So only the technologically necessary parameters should be given.

If the attributes its_technology and/or its_machine_functions are given, the machine is instructed to reach the specified operating conditions before entering the toolpath. Unlike the similar case for workingsteps, no halt is allowed between toolpaths in an operations toolpath list. So the previous toolpath may be adversely affected if a significant change of parameters occurs and the controller tries to provide run up to these parameters prior to the current toolpath. Also, if the time span of the previous toolpath is insufficient to reach stable parameters, there is no guarantee that the new toolpath will be using these parameters from the start. Caution is therefore advised when using technological parameters at the toolpath level. If required, e.g. for special operations requiring a reversing of the spindle rotation, a feedstop toolpath should be inserted in order to grant the machine sufficient time for changing the parameters.";
