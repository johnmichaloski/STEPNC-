<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="transition_feature">transition_feature </A></H1><P>A transition feature may be added at the border of two features. Example: An edge round or a chamfer between two planar faces or between a planar face and a pocket. Unlike in ISO 10303-224, only those transition features which are generated using additional tool movements are considered here. Example: An edge round between a pocket and a planar face needs an additional manufacturing operation (workingstep). On the contrary, a fillet between the sides and the bottom of a pocket results from the geometry of the tool and thus needs no additional tool movement. It is therefore not considered in this context.<H2>Schema</H2>
