<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="region_projection">region_projection </A></H1><P>A type of bounded region generated by projecting a closed curve on a surface. Thus, a region can easily be defined on an existing surface description. The region projection applies to any workpiece surface it hits when moving in space along proj_dir. This is a very simplistic region definition for situations where the use of topology is not desired.<H2>Schema</H2>

<TD>A curve in space, used for specifying the boundary for a surface through its projection on the surface. It must be a closed curve and will usually be in one plane. </TD></TR>

<TD>The depth is a positive scalar value. It describes the distance of material removal into negative z-direction of the region’s local coordinate system. The depth is measured from the raw piece’s surface, onto which the proj_curve has been projected, to the bottom to be machined. The depth is equal for the whole region. In case the bottom’s shape shall not be equal to the raw piece’s surface, the entity pocket and its subtypes have to be used. </TD></TR>
