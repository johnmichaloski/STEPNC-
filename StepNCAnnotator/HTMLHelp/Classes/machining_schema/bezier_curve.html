<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="bezier_curve">bezier_curve </A></H1><P>This subtype represents in the most general case a piecewise B'ezier curve. This is a special type of curve which can be represented as a type of b spline curve in which the knots are evenly spaced and have high multiplicities. Suitable default values for the knots and knot multiplicities are derived in this case. A B­spline curve is a piecewise B'ezier curve if it is quasi­uniform except that the interior knots have multiplicity degree rather than having multiplicity one. In this subtype the knot spacing is 1.0, starting at 0.0. A piecewise B'ezier curve which has only two knots, 0.0 and 1.0, each of multiplicity (degree+1), is a simple B'ezier curve.<H2>Schema</H2>
