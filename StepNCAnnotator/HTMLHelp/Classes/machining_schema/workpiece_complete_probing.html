<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="workpiece_complete_probing">workpiece_complete_probing </A></H1><P>This entity is similar to workpiece probing only that a complete measurement cycle at six locations of the given workpiece is automatically performed and the translation and rotational offset of the detected workpiece position compared to the given workpiece is computed. The locations of probing are automatically determined by the NC controller based on the geometry of the workpiece. The offset vector is returned in computed_offset while the inherited attributed measured_offset will hold the average of all (six) measured offsets. Based on the automatic determination of the probing locations, workpiece_complete_probing does not have a well defined start point.<H2>Schema</H2>
