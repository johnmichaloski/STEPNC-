<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="setup">setup </A></H1><P>This entity includes information concerning the location of the workpieces’ coordinate systems. As one setup might include several workpieces of which each one might have its own coordinate system there is one more hierarchical level of frame of reference: By the setup’s attribute its_origin a cartesian coordinate system is defined relative to the machine coordinate system. It is the frame of reference for the location of each workpiece related to the setup. The setup’s origin is only valid within this particular setup and is not referenced by any other setup.<H2>Schema</H2>
