<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="loop">loop </A></H1><P>A loop is a topological entity constructed from a single vertex, or by stringing together connected (oriented) edges, or linear segments beginning and ending at the same vertex. A loop has dimensionality 0 or 1. The domain of a 0­dimensional loop is a single point. The domain of a 1­dimensional loop is a connected, oriented curve, but need not be a manifold. As the loop is a cycle, the location of its beginning/ending point is arbitrary. The domain of the loop includes its bounds, and 0 Ÿ \Xi ! 1. A loop is represented by a single vertex, or by an ordered collection of oriented edges, or by an ordered collection of points.<H2>Schema</H2>
