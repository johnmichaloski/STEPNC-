<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="workplan">workplan </A></H1><P>The entity workplan allows to combine several workingsteps and NC functions in a linear order. It also serves as an attribute of the top level entity project which has to be provided in each ISO 14649 data model exactly once. The recursive definition of workplan as subtype of executable allows to group manufacturing operations into larger units, e.g. to summarise all turning operations and all grinding operations if a workpiece is to undergo several different processes.<H2>Schema</H2>

<TR><TD>its_elements </TD>
<TD> LIST [ 0 : ? ] OF executable </TD>
<TD>An ordered sequence of executable objects. The workplan cannot contain itself as element. It can only contain itself indirectly within a control structure which allows to skip this workplan in order to prevent an infinite loop. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>its_channel </TD>
<TD><A HREF="../machining_schema/channel.html#channel">channel</A> </TD>
<TD>The identifier of the channel used for the execution of workplan. This is only for machine control systems which support multiple channel operation. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>its_setup </TD>
<TD><A HREF="../machining_schema/setup.html#setup">setup</A> </TD>
<TD>The setup includes the workplan’s global security plane and a zero offset where all feature placements are referred to. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>its_effect </TD>
<TD><A HREF="../machining_schema/in_process_geometry.html#in_process_geometry">in_process_geometry</A> </TD>
<TD>The change to the geometry of the workpiece effected by the operation. A CAM system can use this attribute to describe the predicted effect of this operation on the geometry of the workpiece. If given the controller can compare the geometry change described by this attribute with the geometry change predicted by its internal algorithm. ISO 14649 does not describe how closely the two geometries must match in order for the controller to be considered to be in conformance. </TD></TR>
