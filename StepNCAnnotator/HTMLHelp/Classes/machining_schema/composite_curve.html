<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="composite_curve">composite_curve </A></H1><P>A composite curve is a collection of curves joined end­to­end. The individual segments of the curve are themselves defined as composite curve segments. The parametrisation of the composite curve is an accumulation of the parametric ranges of the referenced bounded curves.<H2>Schema</H2>
