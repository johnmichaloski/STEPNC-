<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="slot">slot </A></H1><P>The entity slot is closely related to the entity pocket. Generally speaking, a slot is a special kind of pocket. ISO 10303-224 lists slot as a separate entity. To be compatible, the entity slot is also included in this schema. The attribute course_of_travel describes the location and extension of the slot. Typically, the slot will be manufactured by a single sweep of a tool along the course of travel. In this case, the width of the slot equals the shape of the tool. In case of a milling operation the shape is given by the tool’s diameter. If a workingstep which manufactures this slot calls for a smaller tool, more than one cut will have to be made.<H2>Schema</H2>
