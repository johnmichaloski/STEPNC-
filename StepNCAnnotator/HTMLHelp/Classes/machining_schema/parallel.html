<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="parallel">parallel </A></H1><P>The parallel entity allows to run several executables in parallel. All branches are started at the same time; the execution of the parallel entity ends when the last branch has finished. If the NC controller determines that the branches cannot be executed in parallel the machine will stop with an error condition. Note that normally parallel execution will require the use of different channels in each branch. NC functions can be used to synchronise events across different channels.<H2>Schema</H2>
