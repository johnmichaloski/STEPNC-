<TD>The placement of the feature relative to the workpiece co-ordinate system. The placement is a translation and/or a rotation which transforms the origin of the workpiece co-ordinate system origin into the origin of the feature’s local co-ordinate system. For information on coordinate systems refer to Section 4.6.4.1.2. If the manufacturing feature is part of a compound_feature, then its placement is defined relative to the compound_feature´s origin. </TD></TR>
