<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="compound_feature">compound_feature </A></H1><P>A compound feature is a feature composed of two or more features. As opposed to the replicate feature, there is no regular spacing between the elements of the compound feature. In general, they will also not be of the same type. The volume of removed material of the compound feature is the union of all volumes of the elements of the compound feature. It is illegal to create a compound feature where the volumes of the elements are not connected in such a way that their union can be machined. Note that the individual elements of the compound feature are associated with machining operation. In addition the compound feature includes by the attribute its_operations all operations of its minor elements.<H2>Schema</H2>
