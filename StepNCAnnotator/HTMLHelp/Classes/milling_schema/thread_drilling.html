<H1>ENTITY <A NAME="thread_drilling">thread_drilling </A></H1><P>Workingstep for thread drilling a hole. This involves a helical movement of the tool. It is sometimes also called \"thrilling\", short for \"thread drilling\". A helical movement may be needed for the forward movement or not. The feed per revolution is calculated from the thread of the hole. The pitch of the helical movement corresponds to the pitch of the thread. The feedrate is the relative speed between tool tip and material along the helical path.<H2>Schema</H2>
