Migrate to SimpleList and ComplexList at code generation?

no delete on simple type or simple list

LIST
	SIMPLE
			delete - clear all (clear())	- DONE
			insert - NO, just overwrite		- DONE
	ENTITY
			insert - add data item - where (at end) - DONE
					 NEED listtype list instead of entity type
			delete entire list - do you realliy want to clear the entire list.
	ENTITY INDEXED ITEM
			insert - fill out entity item. - DONE
			delete - BY INDEX - need deletion use CVarDef _addr to find index, delete use parent info?

	
ENTITY
	if parent is entity, delete subbranch, leave entity since attribute. DELET==Clear
	if parent is list, delete  branch and entity DELETE== delete
	

INSERTALL
	if no cycles create all subchildren. BUT GUESSING? since multiple supertypes per attribute...

	
I NEED CVarDef for list entries: entity is really index into list.
CVarDef must be stored into EListT since there is no other place for it - is there?


INSERT SimpleList: match tokens size and list size (by either deleting or inserting.) Overwrite values using SetString.

COPY: entity->entity match
PASTE: only paste if match of is-kind-of

COPY:
	Simple type - types must match? or attribute names must match
	Simple List Type - only copy entire list from one List owner
	Complex List - 
		1) copy item to list owner, 
			- index classname is actual class, index ListClassname is the subtype to match owner listclassname
		2) copy entire list and replace list.
						
	Clone step node/vardef...

RENUMBER
	renumber complex list type - DONE

Move Up/ DOwn - DONE

Multi-select up/down?
Drag/drop selection for indexes
UNDO
	DELETE - undo is insert at location - problem is tree insert can be iffy given parent and prev sibling...
	INSERT - is delete - simple
	
	
NOTES:
move tree into splitter into main view
FIX: multidimesional lists - look @ safe array for handling multi-dimensional array.


BUG REPORT - use of EString as attribute primitive causes some problems.

"married" to truth, 
push-button CNC
probing with tool offsets using Step-NC, optional stop etc. other
Step-NC already exhibits process incompatabilities. RS274 at least is close.
