The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0 ! \Xi ! 1. A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face bounds. A face shall have at least one bound, and the bounds shall be distinct and shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished, using the face outer bound subtype, as the outer loop of the face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer loop. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop shall contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen. A geometric surface may be associated with the face. This may be done explicitly through the face surface subtype, or implicitly if the faces are defined by poly loops. In the latter case, the surface is the plane containing the points of the poly loops. In either case, a topological normal n is associated with the face, such that the cross product n \Theta t points toward the interior of the face, where t is the tangent to a bounding loop. That is, each loop runs counter­clockwise around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point up. Each loop is associated through a face bound entity with a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop direction is oriented correctly with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be reversed (FALSE). For a face of the subtype face surface, the topological normal n is defined from the normal of the underlying surface, together with the BOOLEAN attribute same sense, and this in turn, determines on which side of the loop the face interior lies, using the cross­product rule described above. When a vertex loop is used as a face bound the sense of the topological normal is derived from any other bounding loops, or, in the case of a face surface, from the face geometry and the same sense flag. If the face has only one bound and this is of type vertex loop, then the interior of the face is the domain of the face surface.face geometry. In such a case the underlying surface shall be closed (e.g. a spherical surface.) The situation is different for a face on an implicit planar surface, such as one defined by poly ­ loops, which has no unique surface normal. Since the face and its bounding loops lie in a plane, the outer loop can always be found without ambiguity. Since the face is required to be finite, the face interior must lie inside the outer loop, and outside each of the remaining loops. These conditions, together with the specified loop orientations, define the topological normal n using the cross­product rule described above.

In this case, the tool will retract in the tool direction from the last point of the previous workingstep. On the security plane the tool will rotate to the new tool direction, and then it will move down in the tool direction for the first point of the next workingstep.

Unlike a workingstep, an operation cannot be executed by itself  unless it is also a workingstep by means of multiple inheritance, like rapid_movement or touch_probing. The latter do not require the presence of a feature for unambiguous interpretation. However, the most typical operation, machining operation, needs an association with a manufacturing feature in order to be interpreted. It relies on the geometric information provided by the feature, namely its placement in the workpiece co-ordinate system. Such association can either be established through a reference from a manufacturing_feature or through a reference from a machining_workingstep which references in turn a manufacturing_feature. The important difference between a workingstep and an operation is in the number of associated features. The workingstep is associated with zero or one features. So at the time of execution the NC controller will know unambiguously which feature to use for geometric placement (or to use workpiece co-ordinates if no feature is associated). A workingstep is thus unique. Duplicating a workingstep in a workplan will replicate the exact same physical machine action. The operation on the other hand can be associated with zero or multiple features. The same operation can thus be used in different locations. The NC controller would be unable to decide on which of the associated features to execute the operation, so an execution of a naked operation is not possible. The reason for this design is the possible re-use of operation data for several manufacturing features. Consider ten identical holes in different positions around the workpiece. They can all share the operation data, but they can not share the workingsteps which represent an operation at a certain instance in time and space. As the heavyweight operation entities can be shared, this may reduce the volume of data to be exchanged. The supertype operation specifies the generic data required by all operations. All operations have the option of specifying an explicit toolpath. For 2½D machining operations, many numerical controls will specify cycles for generating their own toolpaths. However, for older controls which are not able to generate toolpaths or if technological reasons require the communication of exactly prescribed toolpaths, the attribute its_toolpath may be used. Also, the 3-to 5-axis milling of freeform surfaces will typically require the explicit specification of toolpaths by a CAM system.");
