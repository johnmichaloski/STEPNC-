SPath is the StepPath language that provides the ability to navigate around a Step Instance tree, selecting step nodes by a variety of criteria. SPath approximates a small subset of XPath, the XML Expression Path language. In SPath Step Nodes are the equivalent to Express Schema class instances. Each Step Node can have several variables or attributes. Each attribute is described by the IAttribute interface and implemented by CVarDef.<p>
SPath consists of a location path that can be refined by a set of filters. SPath only supports a small set of filters at this time. A location path selects a set of Step Nodes relative to the context node. As an example /feature_placement/location/coordinates traverses the tree from the current Step node down the attribute/node first feature_placement, then location and finally coordinates.<p>
The result of evaluating an expression that is a location path is the node-set containing the nodes selected by the location path. There are two kinds of location path: relative location paths and absolute location paths. Some difference between SPath and XPath, include the need for SPath to be able to create node elements based on an inheritance hierarchy<p>
The SPATH grammar uses Basic EBNF notation. Non-terminals: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">SPath         ::= PathExpr

INDEX         ::=  -2 | -1 | [0..9]+
EXPRESSVAR        ::=  (a-zA-z)(a-zA-z0-9_)*
ClassSeq        ::= <span class="stringliteral">"{"</span> EXPRESSCLASS  <span class="stringliteral">"}"</span>
IndexSeq        ::= <span class="stringliteral">"["</span> INDEX  <span class="stringliteral">"]"</span>
RelativePathExpr    ::= <span class="stringliteral">"/"</span> EXPRESSVAR [IndexSeq] [ClassSeq]
              |  <span class="stringliteral">"//"</span> RelativePathExpr [IndexSeq] [ClassSeq]
PathExpr        ::= [ RelativePathExpr ]+
